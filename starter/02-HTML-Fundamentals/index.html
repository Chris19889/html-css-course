    <!--new to html are Attributes: attributes are basically just a piece of data. 
    Source attribute (SRC)
    Alternative Text attribute(alt="") some text that to describe what the image is about, which is important : 
    Firstly :to allow search engines (chrome) to know what is in the image otherwise it won't know what the image is about
    Secondly by specifying the description of the image, it allows blind people to use the website (screen readers users can have the image described to them)-->

      All modern websites and web applications are built using three
      <strong><em>fundamental</em></strong>
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web.
    </p>

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
      <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language
      that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage
      (not a programming language).
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts: 
      <ol><!--<ol> stands for Ordered List-->
      <li class="bold">The opening tag</li> 
      <li>The closing tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <!--<a></a> creates the tag for the word you want to create a hyperlink with.
    followed by href= and make sure the weblink has "" around it -->
    <p>You can learn more at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/"
    target="_blank"
    >MDN Web Docs.</a></p>
    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the
      web. Here are 5 of them:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <!--<ul> stands for Unordered List
          <li> stands for List item-->
      <li class="bold">To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li">
      <li>
        To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
        Worpress or Wix
      </li>
      <li>To build web applications</li>
      <li>To impress friends</li>
      <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
